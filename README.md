# Threat Forecasting Models

This repository demonstrates the use of statistical and predictive modeling techniques to simulate and forecast national security threats using synthetic spatial-temporal data. The goal is to build familiarity with Poisson regression, time-series forecasting, and spatial-temporal analysis in the context of threat modeling.

## üîç Notebooks

- **01_poisson_regression_threat_counts.ipynb**  
  Simulates threat incident counts and models them using Poisson regression.

- **02_time_series_forecasting_incidents.ipynb**  
  Uses ARIMA and exponential smoothing to forecast future incident trends.

- **03_spatial_temporal_panel_model.ipynb**  
  Creates synthetic spatial-temporal panel data and applies regression to analyze geographic and temporal threat patterns.

- **04_predictive_model_summary.ipynb**  
  Compares models and evaluates predictive accuracy for different threat types.
